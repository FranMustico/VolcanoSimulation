# VolcanoSimulation
The rock trajectory simulation program is a powerful tool for understanding the physics of projectile motion. This software application is specifically designed to simulate the trajectory of a rock that is ejected from a volcano, taking into account various environmental factors such as air resistance.

The user is required to input the initial angle of launch and the initial velocity of the rock. The program then uses advanced physics algorithms to calculate the trajectory of the rock, taking into account various factors that affect its motion, such as air resistance, gravity, and wind direction.

The program provides a detailed graphic simulation of the rock's movement, allowing the user to observe changes in all of the key statistics that relate to the rock. These statistics may include changes in air resistance, velocity, and height, among others.

In addition to the graphic simulation, the program also provides a detailed table of key stats that are displayed for the user. These statistics include the total distance travelled by the rock, the maximum height achieved, the velocity on the x-axis, the velocity on the y-axis, and the resultant velocity of the rock.

Overall, the rock trajectory simulation program is an invaluable tool for understanding the physics of projectile motion. It provides a detailed insight into the way that various factors affect the trajectory of a rock, allowing users to experiment with different initial conditions and environmental factors to explore the full range of possible outcomes. This program is especially useful for students and professionals in the fields of physics, geology, and other related disciplines.
